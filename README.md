# cra-template-dependency-injection

This is a template for [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

It is an opinionated attempt to provide an environment and documentation favoring dependency injection patterns in a React app.
Additionally, it is also based on TypeScript, and includes a very strict linting.

You can specify it by calling Create React App with `--template dependency-injection`.
